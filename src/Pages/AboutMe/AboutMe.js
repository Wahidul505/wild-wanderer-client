            <p className='text-lg font-sans'>Hello, meet myself, Wahid.The goals that I determined many years and months ago are to be a successful, self organized and self dependent person, mostly to marry someone whom I want desperately in my life. Now I have a clear vision of my goals and dreams while completing this course. I want to build website for people as a gift and want to work in a progressing company or someday I will be a entrepreneur, who knows!. Earlier, I didn't recognized that I have a huge potential in programming and web developing. Now that I have visions and goals, I am enjoying every part of it. The last but not least, I will give my parents their comfort zone as a responsible child and be a responsible person.</p>
