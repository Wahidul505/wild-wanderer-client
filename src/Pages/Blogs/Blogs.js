            <h1>Difference Between Authentication and Authorization?</h1>
            <p>• Authentication means validating someones credential to verify that person's identity. In another words, Authentication is the process of verifying someone's identity before that person act something. As example: A logged in or signed up user completed the Authentication process as the website Authenticated the user by creating a account of the user.</p>
            <p>• Authorization means giving access to some particular parts/works/recourses. In another words, whether a Authenticated user has the permission to access any particular work/recourses is determined by Authorization. As example: A user can access the websites private routes/resources after logged in or buying premium packages of the website.</p>
            <h1>Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to implement authentication?</h1>
            <p>• Firebase is Properly managed platform for building dynamic web and mobile apps. Firebase concept is so simple and time saving and also developer friendly.The interesting part is, Firebase provides an easy Authentication system and allow us to use third party authentication provider, like Google, Facebook, Twitter, Github and so on. The Firebase Authentication system is easy to use. Also Firebase allows us to deploy and host our projects.</p>
            <p>• To implement Authentication I can also use:
            </p>
            <h1></h1>
        </div>
    );
};
